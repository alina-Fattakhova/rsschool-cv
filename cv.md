### Briefly about myself

I've started my career in IT a year ago after graduating from course of Quality Assurance engineer.

As i was interested in coding and studied Java just for fun , in no time i've switched to AQA Java engineer and started to work with tools like Selenium WebDriver and RestAssured library for API testing.

Deep diving into Web Application Testing i've found myself to be interested in Web Development, as it gives endless opportunities for professional growth. I am here to get cutting-edge skills that are highly demanded on market and to pursue new career opportunities as a Web Developer.
